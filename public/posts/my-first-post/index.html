<p>This is my first post.</p>
<p>I have created this post to share  my thoughts and views on a variety of topics. Most especially tecchnology, <strong>programming</strong>, and the future of the world. I like to program mostly in <strong>Go</strong>, <strong>Javascript</strong> and <strong>Python</strong>.</p>
<p>I am a <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong> and I am always looking for new ways to improve my skills and knowledge. I like to do most of my work in <strong>Linux</strong> and <strong>Windows</strong>. I am a big fan of <strong>Open Source</strong> and I believe that everyone should have access to the best tools and resources. I have a certiication in kubernetes and I am always looking for new ways to learn and grow. The certification is from <strong>CNCF</strong> and it is called <strong>CKA</strong>.</p>
<p>I started my journey to programming in 2018 and I have been learning ever since.  I have learned a lot and I am always looking for new ways to improve my skills and knowledge.</p>
