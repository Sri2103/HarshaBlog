      <description>Building a Logging and Monitoring Architecture with Kubernetes, Logstash, Elasticsearch, and Kibana Introduction Logs are a critical part of any system, providing insight into application behavior, debugging information, and security monitoring.

      <description>In the simplest terms, grep (global regular expression print) will search input files for a search string, and print the lines that match it.&#xA;Beginning at the first line in the file, grep copies a line into a buffer, compares it against the search string, and if the comparison passes, prints the line to the screen. Grep will repeat this process until the file runs out of lines. Notice that nowhere in this process does grep store lines, change lines, or search only a part of a line.</description>
